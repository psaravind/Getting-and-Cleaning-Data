# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This reposity will be graded by my peers in the "Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data" Sep 2014 class.

Along with this file this repository contains a R script "run_analysis.R" that takes the data from "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones" and creates a tidy data set.

# Script run_analysis.R

This script does the following 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
